# iMoleQ - Phyisco-chemical properties prediction
## Summary
iMoleQ is an upcoming Cloud-based web application designed to predict physico-chemical properties. The development of version 1.0 is currently in progress. The app is built upon our patented research, which utilizes machine learning techniques to forecast partition coefficient (Log P) and distribution coefficient (Log D) using molecular descriptors and liquid chromatography retention time. You can find more details about our research in the publication titled [Using Machine Learning To Predict Partition Coefficient (Log P) and Distribution Coefficient (Log D) with Molecular Descriptors and Liquid Chromatography Retention Time](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01373) accessible through this link. The machine learning models and its dataset can be accessed through this [link](https://github.com/jamesleocodes/p_chem_CEVR.git).

Please stay tune!!!
