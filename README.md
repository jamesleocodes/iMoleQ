# iMoleQ - Artificial Intelligent cloud-based app to assess the chemicals
## Summary
iMoleQ is a Cloud-based web application designed to predict molecular properties. The development of version 1.0 is currently in progress. The app is built upon our patented research, which utilizes machine learning techniques to forecast the partition coefficient (Log P) and distribution coefficient (Log D) using molecular descriptors and liquid chromatography retention time. You can find more details about our research in the publication titled [Using Machine Learning To Predict Partition Coefficient (Log P) and Distribution Coefficient (Log D) with Molecular Descriptors and Liquid Chromatography Retention Time](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01373) accessible through this link. The machine learning models and the dataset can be accessed through this [github repository](https://github.com/jamesleocodes/p_chem_CEVR.git).

The frontend development of iMoleQ has been completed, and you can access it at www.imoleq.com. Currently, we are in the process of integrating the backend with the API and server-side components. Please stay tuned for more updates as we continue to enhance and improve the iMoleQ application.
