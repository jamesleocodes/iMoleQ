                <p>
                    Mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique that measures the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. It is widely used in chemical analysis and bioanalytical studies to identify unknown compounds, determine the structure of molecules, and quantify the amount of compounds in a sample. In molecular properties research, MS can provide detailed information on molecular weights, structures, and interactions.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Machine Learning and Deep Learning Applications</h2>
                <p>
                    Machine learning and deep learning are subsets of artificial intelligence that focus on building systems that learn from data. In the context of molecular research, ML/DL models can be trained on mass spectrometry data to predict molecular properties, classify compounds, and even suggest new molecular structures. These models are capable of handling large datasets and complex patterns that are infeasible for traditional computational methods.

                <p>
                    Recent advancements in neural networks have also enabled the development of algorithms that can learn to predict outcomes from mass spectrometry data with high precision, facilitating rapid hypothesis testing and drug discovery processes.
