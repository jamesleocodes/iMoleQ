                Our team has achieved a breakthrough in improving the estimation of drug efficacy in preclinical evaluations. Traditionally, measuring important physicochemical properties like Log P and Log D is challenging due to low concentrations for highly hydrophobic or hydrophilic species. We overcame these limitations by using machine learning to correlate these properties with liquid chromatography retention time (RT). Our predictive models, incorporating molecular descriptors and RT, achieved a significant improvement in performance (MAE = 0.366, R2 = 0.89). This breakthrough allows for more efficient estimation of drug distribution in the body during preclinical evaluations. Read more about our findings in the latest publication linked below.
